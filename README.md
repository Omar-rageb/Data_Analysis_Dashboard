# Road Accident Dashboard🚑📊
Road safety is a major global issue. In response, I created a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, an Excel tool that analyzes and visualizes road accident data from 2021 and 2022. This dashboard provides stakeholders with valuable insights for making informed decisions to enhance roadway safety.

## Tech Stack Used
![Excel](https://img.icons8.com/color/256/microsoft-excel-2019.png)

## Skills Demonstrated in This Project
- Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis
- Filtering, Sorting and Conditional function.
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Chart
- Data Visulisation and Dashboard creation

  ## Requirements
The clients are interested in developing a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022, with the aim of gaining insights into the following aspects-

- Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
- Primary KPI's-Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
- Secondary KPIs - Total Casualties concerning vehicle type for the Current Year
- Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year
- Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year
- Current Year Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/Night
- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location

## Data Sourcing
The dataset can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18rcs3kEAbeypN9XtlRhWrJ0S8UaBBF7V/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111248752863065150499&rtpof=true&sd=true) .

  ## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.
1.	Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors 
2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
4.	Creating 2 new attributes 'Year' and 'Month' were added for logical and easy interpretation of dataset.


## Data Analysis
Created a "Data Analysis" sheet to summarize all the pivot table Data for a new user or developer or client to ease their work and gathered information. On this sheet nine pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between number of casualties and many factors such as- casualty type, vehicle type, road type, location etc. Monthly trends were also analysed for the years 2021 and 2022.

Below is an excerpt from the Data Analysis Sheet:

 ## Data Visualization

The dashboard was ultimately developed by integrating and customizing pivot charts derived from the corresponding pivot tables. To enhance user experience and interactivity, we incorporated slicers and timelines. Additionally, hyperlinks and connections were added to essential icons to facilitate seamless navigation.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard created in Excel:

## Key Insights

📈 **Total Casualties Analysis:** The dashboard indicates a significant total of  ✔417,883✔ casualties resulting from accidents over the two-year period.

📅 **Peak Months:** The overall number of casualties was slightly higher in 2021 compared to 2022. The highest number of casualties occurred in October and November of both years, while January and February recorded the lowest figures.

🚗 **Casualties by Vehicle Type:** Car accidents were responsible for the majority of casualties, accounting for 79.8% of the total. In contrast, incidents involving other vehicle types resulted in minimal casualties.

🩸 **Casualties by Accident Severity:** Slightly severe accidents constituted the bulk of casualties at 84.1%, while fatalities represented only 1.7% of the total.

🛣️ **Road Type Analysis:** The highest number of casualties occurred on single carriageway roads (310.1K), while slip roads recorded the fewest (5.1K).

🌧️ **Casualties Distribution by Road Surface:** The majority of casualties were reported on dry road surfaces, accounting for 67% of the total.

🏙️ **Casualties by Area/Location:** Urban areas accounted for the majority of casualties following accidents, comprising 61%.

☀️ **Casualties by Light Condition:** A substantial 73% of casualties occurred during daylight conditions.


## Recommendations based on the Analysis

1.	By comparing casualty trends between the current and previous years on a monthly basis, the dashboard identifies critical periods of October and November. The road safety measure by the traffic police and other stakeholders must be active and focused during these high-risk periods. 
2.	Car drivers form bulk of the casualties so they must be targeted for awareness camps and strict monitoring, periodic check-ups on safe driving.
3.	Extra safety measures should be placed Single Carriageway roads and they must be upgraded to double lane wherever possible.
4.	Understanding casualty distribution based on different road surface conditions helps pinpoint areas where road maintenance and surface improvements are essential. 
5.	Urban areas should be targeted for interventions to improve road safety in specific and during daytime.

## End



The Road Accident Analytics Dashboard facilitates data-driven decision-making, empowering stakeholders to implement evidence-based interventions aimed at improving road safety. This dashboard is an invaluable resource for policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety advocates alike.
