# Road Accident Dashboard
Road safety is a major global issue. In response, I created a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, an Excel tool that analyzes and visualizes road accident data from 2021 and 2022. This dashboard provides stakeholders with valuable insights for making informed decisions to enhance roadway safety.

## Skills Demonstrated in This Project
- Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis
- Filtering, Sorting and Conditional function.
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Chart
- Data Visulisation and Dashboard creation

  ## Requirements
The clients are interested in developing a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022, with the aim of gaining insights into the following aspects-

- Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
- Primary KPI's-Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
- Secondary KPIs - Total Casualties concerning vehicle type for the Current Year
- Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year
- Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year
- Current Year Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/Night
- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location

## Data Sourcing
The dataset can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18rcs3kEAbeypN9XtlRhWrJ0S8UaBBF7V/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111248752863065150499&rtpof=true&sd=true) .

  ## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.
1.	Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors 
2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
4.	Creating 2 new attributes 'Year' and 'Month' were added for logical and easy interpretation of dataset.

## Data Analysis
Created a "Data Analysis" sheet to summarize all the pivot table Data for a new user or developer or client to ease their work and gathered information. On this sheet nine pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between number of casualties and many factors such as- casualty type, vehicle type, road type, location etc. Monthly trends were also analysed for the years 2021 and 2022.

Below is a snippet of the Data Analysis Sheet
